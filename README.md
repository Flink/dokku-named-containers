# (DEPRECATED) dokku-named-containers

THIS PLUGIN IS NOW DEPRECATED SINCE IT HAS BEEN INCLUDED DIRECTLY IN DOKKU

dokku-named-containers is a plugin for [dokku][dokku] that names docker containers after your application name.

## Installation

This plugin is compatible with dokku 0.3.26 and 0.4+

```sh
# for dokku 0.3.26
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/Flink/dokku-named-containers.git /var/lib/dokku/plugins/named-containers

# for dokku 0.4+
$ sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/Flink/dokku-named-containers.git
```

## Usage

Thereâ€™s nothing to do or configure after installing this plugin. Just start or restart your applications and their docker container will now be named like this:
```
app-name.web.1
app-name.web.2
app-name.worker.1
```

This is useful when sending logs with logspout to Papertrail for example.
